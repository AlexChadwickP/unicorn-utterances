## All-in-one Solution

One advantage (or disadvantage, depending on who you ask) of Angular is that it provides just about everything you'd need to build a large-scale application. This includes things like an HTTP client, client-side router, lazy-loaded modules, and even an official UI library.

One notible exception is a global data store solution. While you're _able_ to store data in a root injected service, it's simply not as powerful as framework competitors like Redux or Vuex. 

That said, the community is more than happy to create solutions where missing. NgRx is a community project that's healthily maintained by a group of experts.


## Dependency Injection

While Angular's dependency injection is undoubtably more powerful than other component-based frameworks, it's also significantly more complex to get even basic usage up-and-running

Pro: Wide range of APIs and features. Con: Lots of half-baked features such as Reactive Forms, Angular Elements, Standalone Components, Universal Socket Engine, Schematics.
