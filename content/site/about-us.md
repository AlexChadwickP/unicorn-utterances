> Our goal is to provide the best resources possible to learn any computer science related topic

Whether it's from how memory is allocated in assembly or how to do complex CSS animations, to what a For loop is, we want to provide resources that are welcoming, supportive, and informational.

Our content will have a wide range of subject matters, difficulty curves, and (we hope) perspectives. We want to make resources for the seasoned full-time developer just as we would a newcomer hobbyist and everyone between the two.

We know this is a lofty goal, though, and we don't want to do it alone. If you're interested in helping out, [open a pull request](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances/pulls) and help us reach others by providing translations, [help the code maintenance on this site](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), [write a post for us](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances#blog-posts), or [jump in on discussions and help other readers on our Discord](https://discord.gg/FMcvc6T).
 
If youâ€™d like to get in touch with us, [our Discord](https://discord.gg/FMcvc6T) is probably the best way to do so.

## Statement of Ethics {#ethics}

We never want to end up in a place where our educational content, experience,
or community is compromised by either financial sway or potentially harmful
members of the community. As such, we've implemented the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
as our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to uphold these values.

We also pledge to maintain transparency in regards to any finances that flow
through the project. Not every sponsorship contains a financial contribution,
but if one does we will disclose both what those finances
are going towards and what will be done in exchange.
